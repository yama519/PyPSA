control_strategy,string,n/a,n/a,"Loads such as batteries, electric vehicle charging stations contain inverters to convert AC power to DC , which then can be used to charge batteries or for any other purposes. This will cause undervoltage issues in the grid, Inverter controllers are used to avoid under voltage violations  and support the grid to stay in the predetermined allowed voltage ranges by limiting power consumption or reactive power compensation techniques based on the chosen inverter controller type. The supported inverter control types  are: q_v (v1, v2, v3, v4, s_nom, power_factor, damper), fixed_cosphi (power_factor) ,  cosphi_p (set_p1,  set_p2, s_nom, power_factor_min, p_ref) and p_v(v_pu_cr, v_max_curtail, damper). For futher details regarding supported control_types:  https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_flow.html .",Input (optional)
power_factor,static or series,n/a,1,"Power factor is default to 1 and can take values (0, 1], required when control_strategy is chosen ""fixed_cosphi"" and ""q_v"". This factor is used to calculate the amount of reactive power compensation according to the active power generation and the amount of available reactive power capacity  of the inverter.

v1,float,n/a,0.9,"Minimum voltage magnitude per unit for left curve of q_v controller, required when control_strategy is chosen  ""q_v"".  v1 togeather with v2, v3 and v4 are set points for q_v controller reactive power compensation curve. Controller decides the amount of reactive power after finding the location of v_mag_pu of the bus (inverter is connected to) on this curve. This curve has five zones according to possible locations for v_mag_pu of the controlled bus. Zone 1: where v_mag_pu bus is less than v1,  Zone 2: where v_mag_pu bus is between v1 and v2, Zone 3: where v_mag_pu bus is between v2 and v3, Zone 4: where v_mag_pu bus is between v3 and v4 and Zone 5: where v_mag_pu is greater than v4. Zone 1 is undervoltage case, Zone 2 is between normal and undervoltage, zone 3 is neutral zone where no compensation is needed, zone 4 is between normal range and overvoltage and zone 5 is the overvoltage zone. According to the location of v_mag_pu of the bus, controller will provide an amount of reactive power to bring the voltage as closer as possible to zone 3, Therefore, pay attention on choice of v2 and v3 since they form zone 3 where controller recognizes it as the zone that needs no reactive power compensation and uses it as the reference to provide reactive power for other zones occurance.  Note: Throughout the curve this relation v1 < v2 < v3 < v4 should be considered. For further details  https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_flow.html.",Input (optional)

v_pu_cr,float,n/a,0.98,"Voltage per unit critical, is a set point for ""p_v"" controller to start curtailing active power consumption  to the grid or the bus where inverter is connected. Controller takes no action for bus voltages that are greater than this point. As the bus voltage keeps decreasing than this point, the amount of active power reduction  increases until it reach 100%  where no active power is consumed from the grid, this happens when v_mag_pu of the bus reaches  ""v_max_curtail"" which can be minimum allowed voltage in the grid.  For loads the relation"" v_pu_cr"" >"" v_max_curtail"" should be always considered. For further details: https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/power_flow.html.",Input (optional)
v_max_curtail,float,n/a,1.02," Maximum curtailment voltage or ""v_max_curtail"" is a set point for ""p_v"" controller  where controller stops active power consumption from the  grid or the bus where inverter is connected. When the bus voltage  decreases than this point, power consumption stops, which means power consumption curtailment is 100% , and if the bus voltage starts increasing than this point, amount of power reduction or curtailment starts to decrease until it reaches to zero(full consumption), this happens when v_mag_pu of the bus reaches ""v_pu_cr"".
